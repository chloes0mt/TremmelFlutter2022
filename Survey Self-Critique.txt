1. The three things that my project does well are the following: 
* Runs without any errors.
* The space between each question is reasonable, everything looks appropriately spaced out.
* It looks as similar as I could make it look to the example provided in the video
* The slider is functional.
* The logic is mostly correct and an output is returned at the end when the user submits the survey. 


2. There are many things that my project doesn’t do well, among them being the following: 
* The selected answers for the radio buttons do not appear to be saved nor reflected  in the UI upon being selected.
* I intended to implement a function that takes the value of the switch and changes the visibility of the cheese drop down menu based on whether it’s true or false, but I couldn’t figure out how to do that in Flutter so I made that logic part of the message to the user. (Example: “You can have cheese because you’re not lactose intolerant.”)
* I couldn’t figure out how to turn the selected values in the drop down menus into a string for the resulting output.
